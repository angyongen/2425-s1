## Question 1: Date

A date consists of two integers, a month (1 - 12) and a day (1 - 31).  Given three dates (of the same year), we want to find out if the given dates are sorted in increasing order.

Write a program `date` (source file `date.c`) that reads in three pairs of integers from the standard input, in the order of $m_1$, $d_1$, $m_2$, $d_2$, $m_3$, and $d_3$.  Print `yes` to the standard output the date ($m_1, d_1$) is strictly before ($m_2, d_2$), and the date ($m_2, d_2$) is strictly before ($m_3, d_3$).

Think: Can you break this problem down into a simpler sub-problem?

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./date
1 1
12 31
6 6
no
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./date
5 5
6 1
7 3
yes
```

## Question 2: Pressure

A blood pressure measurement is given by two numbers, $s/d$, where $s$ is the systolic reading and $d$ is the diastolic reading.

Given the two readings, the following diagram classifies a given blood pressure measurement into four regions: low, ideal, pre-high, and high.

![BP chart](figures/hbp/hbp.001.png)

Readings that fall on the borders are considered to be in the region to the top and to the right.  For instance, blood pressure 100/80 and 120/70 are considered to fall under the "pre-high" region.

Write a program `pressure` that does the following:

1. Reads in a blood pressure measurement from the standard input as two positive integers,  
2. Determines which region the given blood pressure measurement belongs to according to the chart above, and
3. Prints the region (either `low`, `ideal`, `pre-high`, or `high`) to the standard output, 

Steps 2 and 3 should be solved in the function below:
```C
void print_blood_pressure(long systolic, long diastolic)
{
  :
}
```

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./pressure
80 50
low
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./pressure
100 50
ideal
```

## Question 3: GCD

The GCD, or greatest common divisor, of two integers $a$ and $b$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.  For example, the GCD of 48 and 18 is 6.

To find the GCD of two numbers $a$ and $b$, we repeatedly replace ($a$, $b$) with ($b$, $a$ % $b$) until we have the pair ($c$, 0). $c$ is the GCD of $a$ and $b$.

For example, to find the GCD of 48 and 18, (48, 18) $\rightarrow$ (18, 12) $\rightarrow$ (12, 6) $\rightarrow$ (6, 0). The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6.

Write a program `gcd` (source file `gcd.c`) that reads in two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, and prints their GCD.   The computation should be performed in a function called `compute_gcd` that takes in $a$ and $b$ and returns their GCD.

Your program must solve this problem recursively, without using any loops.

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./gcd
48 32
16
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./gcd
1 1
1
```

# Question 4: Leap Year

A [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) is a calendar year containing an extra day to synchronize the calendar to seasons and astronomical events.  In the Gregorian calendar, years that are multiples of four (except for years divisible by 100 but not by 400) are leap years.

Complete the program `leap.c` so that it reads in an integer representing a year from the standard input and prints out "<year> is a leap year" if the input is a leap year.  Otherwise, print "<year> is not a leap year" to the standard output.

Your program should include a `bool` function `is_leap_year` that takes in the input year and returns `true` if the input is a leap year and returns `false` otherwise.

### Sample run:

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./leap
1995
1995 is not a leap year
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./leap
1996
1996 is a leap year
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./leap
1900
1900 is not a leap year
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./leap
2000
2000 is a leap year
```

# Question 5: Multiple

Given two integers, we want to check if one is a multiple of the other.  By definition, 0 is the multiple of any number.

Write a program `multiple` that reads two integers from the standard input, and prints `true` to the standard output if one integer is the multiple of the other. Print `false` otherwise.

Your program should include a `bool` function `is_multiple` that takes in the two integers and return if one is the multiple of the other.

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./multiple
3 8
false
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./multiple
8 2
true
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./multiple
0 190
true
```
