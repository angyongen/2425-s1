### Flowchart

.fit[![flowchart](../notes/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-0.png)]

---
class: middle,center

## Functions

<!-- Start changes here -->
---
class: top,center

### Functions in Math

$$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

$$f(x) = x^2 + 1$$

$f(2)$ evaluates to $5$

---
class: middle,center,wide

$$m = max(L, k)$$

.fit[![flowchart](../notes/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-6.png)]

---
class: middle,center,wide

Represent the solution to a computational problem<br>as a function.

.fit[![flowchart](../notes/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-7.png)]

---
### Find The Range

- The _range_ of a given list of $k$ integers is the difference between the max and the min values in the list.

- Give an algorithm to find the range given a list $L$ of $k$ integers.

---
class: middle,center,wide

We can try to change

.fit[![flowchart](../notes/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-0.png)]

---
class: middle,center

or refer to existing solutions (as functions)

### $max(L, k) - min(L, k)$

---
class: middle,center

### Abstraction

.fit[![:scale 95%](figures/excalidrawings/delegation.png)]

---
class: top

### Functions

- A powerful tool to help us think at a higher level.

- We can focus on _what_ a function does, not _how_ it does it.

- Free us from worrying about details (e.g., variables $i$ and $m$ are now internal to $max$)

---
class: top

### Find the Mean

- Give an algorithm to find the mean value given a list $L$ of $k$ integers.

---
class: middle,center

## $\frac{sum(L,k)}{k}$

---
class: top

### A C program is just a collection of functions

--
- written by you
- provided by the standard C library
- provided by other libraries

---
class: middle,center

Assume $len(L)$ returns the size of the list.

## $\frac{sum(L)}{len(L)}$


---
### Find the Standard Deviation

Give an algorithm to find the standard deviation of a list $L$ of $k$ integers.

$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum\_{i=0}^{k-1}(l\_i - \mu)^2}{k}}$$

---
class: middle,center

### Let's break it down into sub-problems

---
class: middle,center

### Colour Coded:

.fit[![:scale 95%](figures/excalidrawings/std-dev.png)]
---
class: middle,center

### Pictorially:

.fit[![:scale 50%](figures/excalidrawings/pictorially.png)]
---
class: middle,center

$$\sum\_{i=0}^{k-1}(l\_i - \mu)^2$$

set $\mu$ to $mean(L)$

set $L'$ to $subtract(L, \mu)$

set $L''$ to $square(L')$

set $total$ to $sum(L'')$
---
class: middle,center,wide

### So here's the flowchart:

.fit[![:scale 80%](figures/excalidrawings/huge-flow-chart.png)]

---
class: middle,center,wide

### Decomposing the problem into smaller problems.

.fit[![:scale 80%](figures/excalidrawings/decomposition.png)]

---
class: middle,center,wide

### The smaller problems should be abstracted away.

.fit[![:scale 80%](figures/excalidrawings/abstraction.png)]

---
### Functions we wish for

- $square(L)$
- $subtract(L, \mu)$
- $sqrt(x)$
- $mean(L)$

---
class:center,top

### Hold on, an important detail:

.fit[![:scale 80%](figures/excalidrawings/what-are-the-incoming-arrows.png)]

What are the incoming arrows for?

### Hold on, an important detail:

.fit[![:scale 80%](figures/excalidrawings/function-signatures.png)]

.small[Remember: Functions take inputs and produce outputs.]


---

### Approach to solve computational problems

- _Decompose_ a problem into (simpler, smaller) sub-problems

- Solve the sub-problems one-by-one with appropriate functions  

- Compose the functions to solve the original given task

---
class: center

### Question: What's stopping a function from using itself?

--


Nothing! We can totally do it.

---
class: center, middle
## Recursion

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

---
class: center, middle

Let's go through a few problems that can be solved recursively

---
class: center

### Let's try solving factorial:

Recall:

$$ n! = n \times (n - 1)!$$
and also
$$0! = 1$$

---
class: top, center

### What do we think of this algorithm?
.fit[![:scale 55%](figures/excalidrawings/factorial-basic.png)]

--

.small[Similar issue as to before: The program will not terminate!]

---
class: top, center

### Actual factorial flowchart:
.fit[![:scale 55%](figures/excalidrawings/factorial-fixed.png)]

---
class: top

### Wishful thinking:

In both cases, there are common features:
- The algorithm solved the problem by relying on solutions to _smaller_ or _simpler_ sub-problems.
- The algorithm "does not care" how it's done. Only that the answer is correct.
- The algorithms have "base cases" that they eventually solve.

--

We call this "wishful thinking".

---
class: top

### Recursion: Top-down vs Bottom-up.

Up until this point, we've shown you how to solve Fibonacci and Factorial
using a top-down approach:

--

(Informally) "To solve problem $n$, we trust someone to solve the $n - 1$ case, and
we make use of it to solve our problem."

---
class: top

### Recursion: Top-down vs Bottom-up.

There is another way (slightly different way) of seeing it:

--

We slowly build up bigger and bigger solutions, using parts that we have built up.
---
class: center

### One last example: Finding the max of a list.

Recall we did this last week iteratively. This week, let's try to solve it recursively.

---
class: center

### Before we begin:

.fit[![](figures/excalidrawings/new-max-signature.png)]

---
class: center

### Finding max of 3 elements:

.fit[![](figures/excalidrawings/max-bottom-up.png)]

---
class: center

### Finding max of 3 elements:

.fit[![](figures/excalidrawings/max-3.png)]

---
class: center

### Finding max of 4 elements:

.fit[![](figures/excalidrawings/max-4.png)]

---
class: center

### Finding max of $n$ elements:

.fit[![](figures/excalidrawings/max-n.png)]


---
class: center

### Here's how we represent it in a flowchart:

.fit[![:scale 75%](figures/excalidrawings/max-faulty-flowchart.png)]

--

Gotcha! The base case is missing!

---
class: center

### With the base case back in:

.fit[![:scale 75%](figures/excalidrawings/max-chart-fixed.png)]


---
class: center

### Pop quiz: what about this?

.fit[![:scale 75%](figures/excalidrawings/max-n-question.png)]

---
class: top

### Some details to think about:

- What is the base case? What do we do during the base case?
- How are we decomposing the problem into sub-problems? 
- How do we use the answers of the sub-problems?

# Types

---
class:middle

### `1010010101010101001111010..` can mean

- 1933091
- 34.95108
- `hello`
- an image

---
class:middle

### A variable needs a type to be interpreted correctly.

---
class:middle

### A type is represented by a fixed, finite, number of bits.

### Different types can be represented by a different number of bits.

---
class:middle, center

### 1 bit: `1` or `0`

black or white<br>
true or false<br>
yes or no<br>
S or U

---
class:middle, center

### 2 bits: `11`, `10`, `01`, or `00`

north, south, east, west<br>
spring, summer, fall, winter

---
class:middle, center

### In general, $k$ bits can represent $2^k$ values

---
class:middle

### more bits $\rightarrow$ more memory, but can represent bigger range

### fewer bits $\rightarrow$ less memory, but represent smaller range

---
class:middle

### When writing programs for embedded systems, IoT devices, sensors, etc, you need to be frugal with memory usage.

### In CS1010, however, we will go with more bits for better precision.

---
class:middle, center

## Integers

---
class:middle, center

### 8 bits: 256 different integers

0 to 255 (for unsigned)<br>
-128 to 127 (for signed)

---
class:middle, center

### 64 bits signed


-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 <br>
to <br>
9,223,372,036,854,775,807

---
class:middle, center

## Characters
---
class:middle, center

### 8 bits: 127 different symbols using ASCII standards

```
0-9, A-Z, a-z
<>?:”{}!@#$%^&*
()_+-=[]\';/.,
```

return, tab, escape, etc

---
class:middle, center

### up to 32 bits: Unicode (UTF-8)

11111011000000000 😀

---
class:middle, center

## Real numbers

(also called floating point numbers)

---
class:middle

### There are infinitely many real numbers but only a finite sequence of bits.  

### Not all of real numbers can be represented.

---
class:middle, center

### Not every real number can be presented precisely

E.g., `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004`

---
class:middle, center
background-image: url(figures/foodpanda.png)

---
class:middle, center

### Rule: Use integer type unless you absolutely need to use a real number type.

---
class:middle, center

### We normally use 32, 64, or 128 bits to represent real numbers.

---
class:middle, center

### A variable needs a type to be interpreted correctly.

---
class:top

### Compound type

- A compound type is made out of other _primitive types_.  Example,

    - A word (a sequence of characters)
    - A 2D coordinate (two real numbers $(x, y)$)

---
class:middle, center

set $total$ to $sum(L, k)$<br>
set $avg$ to $mean(L, k)$

$k$ is an integer<br>
$total$ is an integer<br>
$avg$ must be a real number
