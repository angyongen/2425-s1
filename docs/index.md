!!! announcement "Notes for Lecture 3 and for Using C in CS1010"
	Fri Aug 21 16:18:17 +08 2020

	We will cover [Unit 5](05-first-c.md), [Unit 6](06-cs1010-io.md), and [Unit 7](07-arithmetic-ops.md) in Lecture 3.  
	The notes have been posted.

	We have also posted notes on using C in CS1010:
	- [C in CS1010](c-in-cs1010.md) lists and explains the features of C that are banned or discouraged in this module;
	- [CS1010 I/O library](library.md) documents the APIs provided by the `libcs1010` library, something that we provide to shield the pain and danger of using `printf` and `scanf` from you;
	- [C Style](style.md) documents the programming style that we should all follow in CS1010.
	- [Compiler Messages](messages.md) lists the common warnings and errors that students encounter in CS1010.  This list will be

	Welcome to CS1010!  Here are some things that you can do while waiting for the semester to start.

    **Take a Look at General CS1010 Information**

	Take a look at the [crucial information about CS1010](about.md) here.  Scan through the [learning outcomes](outcomes.md) to know what you are expected to learn in this module.

	Note down the [important dates](about.md) on your calendar.

    **Read about CS1010 Policies**

	The [general policies](policies.md) for CS1010 is posted.  Go through it to see what is expected.

    **Read Feedback on CS1010 from Two Years Ago**

	This semester's CS1010 will be conducted in a similar style with the version in 2018. Read [the comments from that batch of students](docs/feedback-1819-s1.pdf) to know what to expect.

    **Explore Some Additional Readings**

	Some extra reading materials curated by Wei Tsang are [available](readings.md).  In particular, check out the articles under _Must Read_ section.  If you have some programming background and are wondering why we are teaching C, read the articles under _Why C_ section.

    **Enable Your Piazza Account**

	You should have received an email inviting you to create a Piazza account and enroll in the module Q&A forum.  Please join CS1010 on Piazza.

    **Enable Your SoC Account**

	Go to https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct and create your SoC Unix Account if you have not done so.  Activate "General Unix Servers" and "The SoC Compute Cluster" in MySoC here: https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/services.cgi

    **Create a GitHub Account**

	Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account if you do not have one.  This account should stay with you for your professional career.  So choose the username wisely.
