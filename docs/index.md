	[Exercise 8](ex08.md) is now posted.  This exercise consists of three questions on string operations.

!!! announcement "Lecture 7"

	In this jam-packed lecture, we delve deeper into pointers, memory, and arrays.  We will start by introducing [the referencing and dereferencing operators](15-pointers.md), and show how they can be used to [pass an argument by reference](16-call-by-reference.md).  We then explore [heap memory management](17-heap.md), and use it as the basis for dynamically-sized arrays. Finally, we will look at a special type of arrays -- [the strings](18-string.md).  THis lecture covers Units 15-18.

!!! announcement "Exercise 5"

	[Exercise 5](ex05.md) is posted.  Give it a try after completing your Assignment 3.  Exercise 5 contains very simple problems that you can solve with fixed-length arrays.  If you are new to programming, we encourage you to try it out before completing Assignment 3.

!!! announcement "Lecture 6"

	Lecture 6 consists of two parts.  In Part 1, we will delve deeper into how functions are called in C (and other languages), to get a better understanding of the behavior of your program.  We will learn how [call stacks](13-call-stack.md) works. In Part 2, we will start exploring arrays in C.  We will focus on [fixed-length arrays](14-array.md) for this lecture.

	[Exercise 3](ex03.md) is posted.  Give it a try after completing your Assignment 2.  Exercise 3 contains very simple problems that you can solve with five commonly used "patterns" of loops.  If you are new to programming, we encourage you to try it out before Exercise 4 and Assignment 2, which builds upon these patterns to solve more complex problems.

!!! announcement "Lecture 5"

	In Lecture 5, we will discuss how we can [reason about our code using assertions](10-assert.md), how we can control the flow of C programs with [loops](11-loop.md), and how to reason about the behavior of loops with [invariants](12-invariant.md).

!!! announcement "Getting Ready for CS1010"
	Welcome to CS1010!  Here are some things that you can do while waiting for the semester to start.

    **Take a Look at General CS1010 Information**

	Take a look at the [crucial information about CS1010](about.md) here.  Scan through the [learning outcomes](outcomes.md) to know what you are expected to learn in this module.

	Note down the [important dates](about.md) on your calendar.

    **Read about CS1010 Policies**

	The [general policies](policies.md) for CS1010 is posted.  Go through it to see what is expected.

    **Enable Your Piazza Account**

	You should have received an email inviting you to create a Piazza account and enroll in the module Q&A forum.  Please join CS1010 on Piazza.

    **Enable Your SoC Account**

	Go to https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~newacct and create your SoC Unix Account if you have not done so.  Activate "General Unix Servers" and "The SoC Compute Cluster" in MySoC here: https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~myacct/services.cgi

    **Create a GitHub Account**

	Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account if you do not have one.  This account should stay with you for your professional career.  So choose the username wisely.  Then, [tells us your GitHub Username here](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg/modules/600de8e9-67ec-47dd-b597-a2eeadb45792/survey/9ce6eba8-56de-4224-b211-7eddb16930db) before 13 August 2021, Friday.

    **Get a Head-Start with Unix and Vim**

	 You can check out the content for [SoC Unix@Home Workshop](https://nus-unix-workshop.github.io/2021-s1), which was held last year.  The website contains notes with examples, which you can follow through.  If you have questions or face any issues, ask on Piazza.

	 You can also find more notes under "Software/Tools".

    **Read Feedback on CS1010 from Last Year Ago**

	This semester's CS1010 will be conducted in a similar style with the version in AY2020/21. Read [the comments from that batch of students](docs/feedback-2021-s1.pdf) to know what to expect.

    **Explore Some Additional Readings**

	Some extra reading materials curated by Wei Tsang are [available](readings.md).  If you have some programming background and are wondering why we are teaching C, read the articles under _Why C_ section.
