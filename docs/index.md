	We have also posted notes on using C in CS1010:

	- [C in CS1010](c-in-cs1010.md) lists and explains the features of C that are banned or discouraged in this module;
	- [CS1010 I/O library](library.md) documents the APIs provided by the `libcs1010` library, something that we provide to shield the pain and danger of using `printf` and `scanf` from you;
	- [C Style](style.md) documents the programming style that we should all follow in CS1010.
	- [Compiler Messages](messages.md) lists the common warnings and errors that students encounter in CS1010.  This list will be 
	updated throughout the semester.
